\chapter{Data}

Our main source of data is the Cantus database (\cite{cantus_db}), one of the databases indexed in the Cantus Index. The database serves as a 
digital archive of chants, each entry containing information about its source, liturgical occasion, mode, and others. Work on the project started
in the late 1980s, and to date, around 500,000 individual chants from approximately 150 manuscripts have been indexed. Each entry is transcribed 
manually and undergoes a thorough examination before publishing (\cite{cantus_lacoste}).

We are using a scraped version of the Cantus database released as CantusCorpus (\cite(chant21)). Unlike the Cantus database which is continuously being
updated and is therefore unsuitable for computational study, the corpus is versioned, therefore each version always contains the same data. We are using
version 0.2 released in July 2020 which contains 497,071 entries. However, a majority of the data is not suitable for this application, as they do not
contain all the necessary fields, therefore we are only using a subset of size around 13,000. The corpus is available for download in CSV format.

\section{CSV}

CSV is one of the most common formats for tabular data. The abbreviation stands for \emph{comma-separated values}. As the name suggests, the format
uses commas to separate columns (although other separators, such as a semicolon, can be used as well to allow for simpler parsing in case that the data 
frequently contains commas that would otherwise need to be escaped), while the individual rows are separated by a line break. The data is stored as plaintext,
which makes it easily readable. Parsing CSV files becomes more complicated when the data contains column and row separators inside fields; in that case
quotation marks or esape sign has to be used. There exist many well-designed parsers, one such parser is the Python module simply called \emph{csv}.
This application uses the module \emph{pandas} to parse CSV files, which in turn uses the \emph{csv} module.

\section{Database fields}

The following table represents the data fields in the database.

\section{User-defined data}

The application enables user to upload their own dataset. The following table specifies the fields in the database. If a CSV in an
incorrect format is uploaded (e.g. the required fields are empty), the application will not work properly. The meaning of the individual
fields is as described in the previous section unless said otherwise.

\section{Volpiano}

The melodies in the volpiano fields are encoded as strings of alphanumeric characters and dashes. These can be rendered as musical notation using
the volpiano font. Each character represents either a pitch, empty space, or other musical characters, such as a clef.

Volpiano was developed as a research tool optimized for databases and word processors. There are strict rules concerning the transcription, which leads
to all volpiano-encoded melodies having a standardized format. Each transcription begins with a treble clef. Gaps between words are encoded as three
dashes, while two dashes represent gaps between syllables (\cite{volpiano}).

\begin{figure}[h]

\includegraphics[scale=0.1]{volpiano}
\caption{Example of volpiano as stored in the database and how it is rendered as musical notation. \cite[Figure~2]{cantus_lacoste}}
\end{figure}

\section{Data cleaning}

As mentioned earlier, not the entire dataset is usable. Since we are analysing melodies, it is necessary that each data point contains information
about the chant's melody.

As one of the application's main features is melody alignment, it is necessary that we only use those data points whose \emph{volpiano} field is
not empty. Moreover, some visualizations compare text length to melody length, therefore we require the data points to have both. Additionally, 
text and melody should be able to be aligned, i.e. they contain the same number of words and syllables.

Removing the data that does not adhere to the conditions, we are left with 13,397 usable data points.
